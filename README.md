**OVERVIEW**

The Loan Prediction System is designed to help bank employees assess customer eligibility for loans based on various personal and financial attributes. The model uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan, based on input data such as employment history, income, credit history, and other factors.
